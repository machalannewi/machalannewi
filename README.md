Hi there 👋


I am a FullStack Developer and keyboard smasher😶

I specialize in JavaScript and Typescript(I have insecurities), debugging crises(I debug 10X more than i actually code. Terrible!!!)

Anyway, check out my Tech Stack below ⤵️

👨‍💻 TECH STACK ??? (or how I fool people into thinking I know stuff) 


            Frontend: React (when hooks behave), CSS (I hate media queries so i just learnt Tailwind)
            
            Backend: Node.js, (Express for expressing my pain), PHP (old but i think it's still Gold)
            
            Database: PostgresSQL (I JOIN tables like I JOIN bad decisions), MongoDB (for when I forget what structure means)


🔭 Currently debugging: My life choices


⚡ Fun fact:           I have git reset --hard more relationships than repositories(Maybe I am toxic)


📜 Famous Last Words:   

                        "It works on my machine"


                        "I will fix it later" (Spoiler: I won’t)


                        "This is just a quick fix" (Entire codebase collapses)
                        

                        "It’s not a bug, it’s a feature"
